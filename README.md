**Event-site**

helps to register an users for on events conducted in college fests with simple logic with secured way

Fests, whether technical or cultural, are a major part of a college studentâ€™s life. Several colleges conduct techno-cultural fests every year, with countless events for students to take part in, for which they host websites for easy access to information, registrations, and payments for the same.

Our goal was to create a similar website for booking and registering for events of our fest. 
Our simple way of handling the database and the backend makes it easier for any user to access the website or the code itself. 

We hope to simplify the process of going through several procedures before actually registering for an event and improve the quality of fests in general.
